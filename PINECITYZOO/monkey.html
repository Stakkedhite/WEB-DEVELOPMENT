                        <h2>MONKEYS</h2>
                        <p>
                            In 1812, Ã‰tienne Geoffroy grouped the apes and the Cercopithecidae 
                        <br>group of monkeys together and established the name Catarrhini, 
                        "Old World monkeys" ("singes de l'Ancien Monde" in French).
                        <br> The extant sister of the Catarrhini in the monkey ("singes") 
                        <br>group is the Platyrrhini (New World monkeys).Some nine million
                        <br> years before the divergence between the Cercopithecidae and the apes,
                        <br>the Platyrrhini emerged within "monkeys" by migration to South America from Afro-Arabia (the Old World),
                        <br>likely by ocean.[9][10][better source needed] Apes are thus deep in the tree of extant and extinct monkeys,
                        <br> and any of the apes is distinctly closer related to the Cercopithecidae than the Platyrrhini are.

                        </p>
                        <p>Many monkey species are tree-dwelling (arboreal), although there are species that live primarily on the ground, such as baboons. 
                        <br>Most species are mainly active during the day (diurnal). Monkeys are generally considered to be intelligent, especially the Old World monkeys.

                        <p>You will find the monkeys at pen E23, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
