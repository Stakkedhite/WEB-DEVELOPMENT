                        <h2>KOALA</h2>
                        <p>
                           The koala (Phascolarctos cinereus), sometimes inaccurately called the koala bear, 
                           is an arboreal herbivorous marsupial native to Australia. 
                           It is the only extant representative of the family Phascolarctidae. 
                           Its closest living relatives are the wombats. 
                           The koala is found in coastal areas of the island's eastern and southern regions, 
                           inhabiting Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. 
                           It is easily recognisable by its stout, tailless body and large head with round, fluffy ears and large, dark nose.
