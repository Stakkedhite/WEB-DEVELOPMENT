                <h3>Who is Iron Man</h3>
                <p>Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark was a billionaire industrialist,
                <br> a founding member of the Avengers, and the former CEO of Stark Industries.
                 A brash but brilliant inventor, Stark was self-described as a genius, 
                 <br> billionaire, playboy, and philanthropist. 
                 <br> With his great wealth and exceptional technical knowledge, 
                 <br> Stark was one of the world's most powerful men following the 
                 <br> deaths of his parents and enjoyed the playboy lifestyle for many
                 <br>  years until he was kidnapped by the Ten Rings in Afghanistan, 
                 <br> while demonstrating a fleet of Jericho missiles. With his life on the line, 
                 <br> Stark created an armored suit which he used to escape his captors. 
                 <br> Upon returning home, he utilized several more armors to use against terrorists,
                 <br>  as well as Obadiah Stane who turned against Stark. Following his fight against Stane,
                 <br>  Stark publicly revealed himself as Iron Man.
