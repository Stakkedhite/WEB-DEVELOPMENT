                <h3>Who is Hawkeye</h3>
                <p>Clinton Francis "Clint" Barton is an extremely skilled marksman,
                <br>a former special agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. and one of the founding members of the Avengers. 
                <br>Known for his use of the bow and arrow as his primary weapon and his extremely keen eyesight and accuracy,
                <br> which earned him the codename Hawkeye, Barton had become one of the best S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, responsible
                <br> for the recruitment of Black Widow, with whom he developed a strong friendship. Assigned by Nick Fury into
                <br> watching over the Tesseract, he was brainwashed by Loki and used as his pawn in his attempt to become king
                <br> of Midgard. However, after the Attack on the Helicarrier, Black Widow freed him from Loki's mind control,
                <br> and he joined the Avengers in the Battle of New York, helping to defeat Loki and the Chitauri army before 
                <br>returning to his work at S.H.I.E.L.D.
