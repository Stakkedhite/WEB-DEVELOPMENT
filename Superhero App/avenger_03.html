             <h3>Who is HULK</h3>
                <p>Doctor David Bruce Banner, M.D., Ph.D., 
                 <br>  is a renowned scientist and a founding member of the Avengers.
                 <br> Highly respected for his work in biochemistry, nuclear physics 
                 <br>and gamma radiation, Banner was tasked by Thaddeus Ross to recreate
                 <br> the Super Soldier Serum that created Captain America. However, 
                 <br>Ross elected not to inform Banner what he was creating. During the experiment, 
                 <br>Banner substituted vita radiation for gamma radiation and administered the serum on himself. 
                 <br>As a result, the mild-mannered scientist found that when angered, provoked or excited, 
                 <br>his body and brain would transform into a huge, rage-fueled, primitive-minded creature known as the Hulk.
